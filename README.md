# sheepish-escape-libGDX-java
This is my first game published in 2015. It's a 2D game I created by libGDX (https://libgdx.com/). 
#### Note: 
The libGDX version used to create the project is 1.7.1 that is an old version. Current version of the library in the time of writing is 1.11.0. So, to use this code and run the game, you probabely have to fix some errors related to libGDX version and perhaps some features may not work.
